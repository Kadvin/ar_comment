  def self.up
    create_table "roles",:force => true, :comment => 'Play Role' do |t|
      t.string   "name",  :null => false, :comment => "Ghost Name"
      t.string   "type",  :null => false, :comment => "Sword Type"
      t.timestamps
    end
  end

Role.human_name       # => "Play Role"

Role.human_attribute_name('name') # => "Ghost Name"

column = Role.columns_hash['name']
